# mac-mouse-fix-localization-file-hosting

The plan is to automatically upload .xcloc files for Mac Mouse Fix translators to the Releases page of this repo.

We don't want anyone to actually look at this repo, it's just that GitHub Releases is the most straight-forward way I can think of right now to host automatically generated zip files. 

- I guess we could use Amazon Web Services or something but that's more complicated and I'm not as familiar. 
- We tried uploading to GitHub Gists and uploading to github.com/noah-nuebling/mac-mouse-fix/assets (where files are stored when you attach them to a comment) but I couldn't get either to work
- We could host these files in the Release for the mac-mouse-fix repo, but I don't want to clutter things up.

- If we could make this repo private we might want to do that.
